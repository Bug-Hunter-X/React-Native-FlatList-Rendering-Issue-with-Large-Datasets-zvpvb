This bug occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that when scrolling quickly, the FlatList fails to render items correctly, resulting in blank spaces or incorrect data being displayed. This is often exacerbated when using complex item components or when performing data-intensive operations within the renderItem function.  It's particularly noticeable on lower-end devices.
